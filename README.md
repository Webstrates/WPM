# Webstrate Package Manager

This script allows you to programmatically install and manage WPM packages 
in your webstrates. It supports downloading them remotely from the web or
activating them locally from the webstrate itself.

## Installation

To get the latest **stable** release simply include the following script in the head of your page:

`<script id="WPMv2-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Webstrates/WPM@v2.22/WPMv2.js"></script>`

If you rather want to live on the **bleeding edge** you can add the following script to the head section of the page instead:


`<script id="WPMv2-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Webstrates/WPM@master/WPMv2.js"></script>`

Once installed, you can start fetching packages by writing code that makes use of the `.require()`-function

## New empty webstrate

Instead of manually installing the script in the head section of a webstrate you can create a new empty one from our prototype URL:

`Not yet available`
